					<p class="FAQ-p">1. How is my grade determined?</p>
					<p class="FAQ-psub">PTPS can only be taken on a pass/no pass basis, and you need 70% to pass.</p>
					<p class="FAQ-psubsub">There are four main requirements:</p>
					<p class="FAQ-psubsub">1. Attending DeCal</p>
					<p class="FAQ-psubsub">2. Attending your class</p>
					<p class="FAQ-psubsub">3. CSPIIJ</p>
					<p class="FAQ-psubsub">4. Turning in your Reader at the end of the semester which contains all your
					lesson plans and student attendance records.</p>
					<p class="FAQ-p">2. Does PTPS require a minimum SAT score to become a teacher?</p>
					<p class="FAQ-psub">No! In our experience, our teachers’ SAT scores have not had an effect on their teaching effectiveness. What is more important is a teacher’s passion and ability to connect with their students.</p>

					<p class="FAQ-psub">There are a multitude of reasons why you should teach, regardless of your SAT score. We serve a wide range of high school students with initial scores ranging from below 1500 to over 2200. High school students appreciate
					teachers with similar backgrounds. We also provide you with all the
					teaching materials you need to review the material you will be teaching
					beforehand.</p>

					<p class="FAQ-p">3.What do PTPS teachers go on to do?</p>

					<p class="FAQ-psub">Many of our teachers go on to other paid tutoring/teaching jobs, and PTPS teachers are actively recruited by organizations like Teach for America, CollegeSpring, Aspire Education, and Breakthrough Collaborative for full-time and summer jobs. PTPS teachers and coordinators use their PTPS experience to get involved in other organizations and companies, such as SLC tutoring, private tutoring, working in other non-profits, working in for-profit companies, and becoming undergraduate student instructors (UGSIs).</p>

					<p class="FAQ-p">4. How can I become a coordinator (coord)?</p>

					<p class="FAQ-psub">Every semester, anyone can apply for any position. We look for applicants who work well with others, can make the time commitment to PTPS, and have the motivation and drive to implement new initiatives to better the program.</p>

					<p class="FAQ-p">4.Who will I be teaching with?</p>

					<p class="FAQ-psub">You will have a teaching partner. However, due to scheduling conflicts or a teacher’s personal preference, it is possible to teach alone.</p>

					<p class="FAQ-p">5.Do I need to teach math and verbal?</p>

					<p class="FAQ-psub">No, you will be teaching math or verbal, based on the preferences you stated in your application.</p>

					<p class="FAQ-p">6.Do I need to make my own lesson plans?</p>

					<p class="FAQ-psub">No, we provide you with all the curriculum resources needed. However, you are free to run your class as you see fit.</p>

					<p class="FAQ-p">7.What is CSPIIJ?</p>

					<p class="FAQ-psub">Each PTPS teacher is expected to contribute an extra two hours of CSPIIJ. This usually entails leading a workshop.</p>

					<p class="FAQ-p">8.How much of a time commitment is PTPS?</p>

					<p class="FAQ-psub">It is usually a 4 to 5 hour weekly commitment, depending on your transit time. Your transit time is dependent on the preferences you stated on your teacher application and the schedule of each site. CSPIIJ is an additional 2
					hours, and grading at the beginning and end of the semester necessitates
					additional time. A few sites require fingerprinting and TB testing. You will
					have time to lesson plan with your teaching partner during DeCal.</p>

					<p class="FAQ-p">9.Will I be compensated for any expenses?</p>

					<p class="FAQ-psub">Yes, you are compensated for BART travel costs. Your AC Transit Class Pass allows you to ride all AC Transit buses for free. If your site requires
					fingerprinting or TB testing, you will also be compensated for that.</p>

					<p class="FAQ-p">10.Can I teach at more than one site?</p>

					<p class="FAQ-psub">Yes, and if you do so, you can take PTPS as a three-unit class.</p>
