<p class="teacher-p">Welcome Prospective PTPS Teachers!</p>

<br></br>

<p>Are you someone interested in teaching, but has never taught before? Do you want to gain experience? Or are you purely interested in volunteering? PTPS is constantly looking for new teachers. You can find the syllabus <a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~ptps/documents/PTPS_Spring%2013%20Syllabus.doc">here</a>! </p>

<p class="teacher-p">Learning to Teach</p>

<br></br>

<p>PTPS teachers attend an intensive, four-hour long retreat/workshop before ever leading their first class. PTPS is committed to bringing expertise into our classrooms.  Just because students can't afford to sign-up with Kaplan or the Princeton Review* doesn't mean they deserve anything less than the best preparation we can provide.</p>

<p>Overall, the amount of work you put in comes to about five hours a week: two hours in a training seminar, two in front of your class, and about one hour preparing for your class.  Don't worry, though; you'll have a teaching partner with whom to commiserate.</p>

<p>Two pairs of teachers share teaching duties at each site. Each pair teaches a two hour Math or Verbal class for the length of the course. As a teacher, you can choose which area you prefer to teach: Math or Verbal. All four teachers teach on the same day at the weekend sites while weekday classes are spread over two days. Go to schedule of classes to see how it's organized this semester.</p>

<p>*Note: PTPS is not affiliated with or endorsed by either Kaplan or the Princeton Review.</p>

<p class="teacher-p">Training and Earning Credit:</p>

<br></br>

<p>Our training course is also an approved Education 97/197 DeCal course which can be taken for one or two pass/no pass units. Additionally, our class fulfills the Field Training Requirement for Cal's Undergraduate Education Minor Program.</p>

<p>PTPS doesn't only teach how to teach, but also presents discussion of diverse issues dealing with education. You'll hear not only from us, but also from a variety of guest speakers who will discuss anything from college admissions to what's happening in education today. You can find more information on our DeCal website.</p>
