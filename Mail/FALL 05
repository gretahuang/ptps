Hi,

I'm a third-year graduate student here at Cal, and I'm interested in
teaching for PTPS sometime this year.  Will there be fall classes?  Is
demand for teachers greater in one semester or the other?  Since I'm a
grad student, my schedule is pretty flexible, so I'd like to teach where
(and when) you have the greatest need.

Thanks,
Katie.
