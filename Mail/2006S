Hello.
   
  I registered for the UC Berkeley I Saturday 12-4:30 pm class.
   
  So I went to 2312 Tolman Hall Saturday at 12:00pm, and there was no one there. Except for debate students, there was no person affiliated with PTPS. Please tell me the room number for this class. I checked the website and it had the fall schedule 2005. Could you update it to a 2006 version with class times and locations? Thank you.

Hello. 
   
  I registered for the UC Berkeley I SAT class that starts Feb 18th at 12-4:30pm. I went 
   
  to 2312 Tolman Hall today but no one from PTPS was there. Please give me an 
   
  updated spring 2006 schedule complete with the times and locations. Thank you.

Hi,
I'm wondering when the start of registration for the classes for the
May 6th test is. Also, just in general, would this class use the
collegeboard sat book? Thank you.

Hello,

 

My name is Kevin and I am a co-coordinator for a mentorship program here at
Cal for high school students around the Bay Area.  I was interested in
having the People's Test Preparation Services attend one of our mentorship
days to put on a SAT workshop for the students since SATs is coming around,
if that's okay.  We would really appreciate it, thank you.

 

K. Lee

Are SAT preparation classes being offered now? I am not sure of the  dates. 
 
The PTPS website shows classes for this past fall starting in Sept.  05. 
 
Will the site be updated soon or are the classes continuos?
 
  
Thank You
Richard Luchini

Hi, I'm a student at Berkeley 3rd yr MCB major. I'm interested in teaching
for PTPS SAT math and receiving 1 unit, and I have a few questions. The
website indicates that there is a weekly training class on Tuesdays 5:30 -
7:30 pm, but I have a class from 6:30-8 pm TuThrs. Is there any way I can
still teach for PTPS for credit, such as SAT II private tutoring that
doesn't require attending the training classes? thanks.

Hello,
I was wondering if you were still offering free SAT prep to East Bay 
students this semester and if so where and when?
The schedule posted on your website is for Fall 2005.
Many thanks,
