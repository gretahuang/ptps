This is correctly set up, which is why this works -- but have a look at
the permissions on your script:

-rw-r--r--+ 1 ptps ocf 3322 2007-01-30 21:08 /services/http/users/p/ptps/form.php

These permissions mean anyone on the OCF can read your (very weak) MySQL
password.  I would suggest correcting the permissions on this file
("chmod 600 /services/http/users/p/ptps/form.php" from the command line
will do the trick) and changing your MySQL password (run "makemysql").
If you have any other scripts containing your MySQL password, you'll
want to check the permissions on those as well.

It's been a long time since users were allowed to log in to death
directly.  Use ocf.berkeley.edu to get one of our main login servers,
=66rom where you will be able to access and modify your files.

Hello,

An account has been created for you on our MySQL server:

    Hostname: mysql.ocf.berkeley.edu
    Username: ptps
    Database: ptps

The password needed to access your database should have been
shown to you when you ran the 'makemysql' command. If you have lost
the password, simply re-run 'makemysql' to get a new password.

You should have complete access to any table named 'ptps.<table_name>'
(i.e., the ptps database), but not to the rest of the server.
You cannot create more databases, but you may create as many tables
as you wish within your database. You can access the MySQL server
from an OCF command prompt simply by typing:

    mysql

and entering your MySQL password when prompted. (Note: Please don't
provide a password on the command line with the -p option, as anyone
who happens to run a command like 'w' or 'ps' can see it plainly.)
If you need to change your password, just re-run 'makemysql', which
will generate a new password for your database.

If you have any questions, first check our database support page,
accessible at

    http://docs.ocf.berkeley.edu/wiki/MySQL_support

If your question is not addressed, then feel free to email us at

The username is your OCF username. If you forgot your password, you can
run makemysql. Although, it shouldn't have changed. In any case, it
should be safe enough to reset it.

Hello,

An account has been created for you on our MySQL server:

    Hostname: mysql.ocf.berkeley.edu
    Username: ptps
    Database: ptps

The password needed to access your database should have been
shown to you when you ran the 'makemysql' command. If you have lost
the password, simply re-run 'makemysql' to get a new password.

You should have complete access to any table named 'ptps.<table_name>'
(i.e., the ptps database), but not to the rest of the server.
You cannot create more databases, but you may create as many tables
as you wish within your database. You can access the MySQL server
from an OCF command prompt simply by typing:

    mysql

and entering your MySQL password when prompted. (Note: Please don't
provide a password on the command line with the -p option, as anyone
who happens to run a command like 'w' or 'ps' can see it plainly.)
If you need to change your password, just re-run 'makemysql', which
will generate a new password for your database.

If you have any questions, first check our database support page,
accessible at
