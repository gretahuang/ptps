Hey Jessica,
Sorry it took so long for us to get back to you. I'm not sure of anywhere
in particular that provides free diags, but I know that the College Board
has released some diags and you could self-administer any of those
exams... sorry i know that isn't very helpful. Let me know if we could
help at all any more.

Sorry it took so long for us to get back to you. Summer is pretty much
over so I guess this isn't very helpful. We weren't offering classes this
summer, and we weren't really aware of any classes that were particularly
affordable. If you are still interested in any courses, we will be
updating our website shortly with the fall schedule of classes and I
encourage you to check them out.

Hi Carla,
Sorry for taking so long to respond to you. I hope that your summer went
well. We offer about 9 to 10 week long classes (schedule is currently
being finalized) in both the Fall and Spring semesters as well as
workshops. If you are interested in us conducting classes specifically for
your program or even a specialized workshop, please let us know. We look
forward to working with you in the future.

Hi Adetunji,
Sorry for taking so long to respond (nobody has checked this account for
quite some time). We would love for you to join us this semester as a
teacher, and if you are still interested in teaching please let me know as
we are currently recruiting teaches for the fall semester. Courses begin
in just a few weeks and we are beginning to accept applications and
conduct interviews. I hope that all is going well.

Hello,
Last year when I was working as a Chief of Staff in the Academic Affairs
Office, I recall that there was a group that could pick up electronic junk
that could not be thrown away that works on campus. I remember it being at
this address (sustainability@asuc.org) that we sent the request. I would
like to request the same service for a student group on the 3rd floor of
Eshleman (PTPS in 304A). If someone could help us out with this, we would
greatly appreciate it.

Regards,

Nithya Senra

Hello Nithya,

Thank you for replying back to me and I do apologize for my delayed
response, but I just been hired as an instructional teacher at UC
Merced and with its opening tomorrow we have all been swamped.
Nonetheless, considering that your test prep materials are catered to the
under served and disadvantaged students I think that it would a perfect
fit for the students surrounding UC Merced considering that they fall into
that category.  My own teaching experience and work with disadvantage
students comes from being a 2004 Teach For America corps member.  I was
located in Baltimore, MD, where I was a biology and chemistry high school
teacher.  While working as a teacher I also worked towards and achieved my
Masters degree in teaching from Johns Hopkins.

I would like to start a SAT prep program in this area using your guys'
material.  Coming out for training sessions will be difficult
considering that I have to teach every day but I am sure that we can work
something out.  Please let me know what your requirements are for someone
to use your material and so forth.  If you have another
questions please feel free to call me at 209 678 7068.

Thank you and I look forward to working with you,

Simren

semester, and revise and develop our own test prep materials and use
other publications in the teaching process. I don't anticipate it being
a problem for you to attend our initial training sessions, but we do
train our teachers throughout the semester and it might be difficult to
commute from Modesto every week. Our teacher manual and student manual
probably can be shared, but I would have to check with other
coordinators to make sure that it would be permissible.

recently moved back home to central California (Modesto area) and was
interested in starting a free SAT prep course for the local high
school students.  I have heard great things about your program and was
wondering, what is your policy on other people using your material?  I
would love to be a teacher for you but being located so far away the
commute would not work and to my knowledge there are no other official
SAT prep courses in this area, leaving these students at a great
disadvantage.  Please reply back and let me know if we could work
something out.  I would be willing and actually prefer to even come to
your training session to get a better feel for your material.  And of
course to keep with your purpose I would also be providing the service
for free to the local community.
