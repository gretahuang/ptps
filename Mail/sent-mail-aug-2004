Subject: Your MySQL account information

Hello,

An account has been created for you on our MySQL server:

    Hostname: death.ocf (AKA www.OCF)
    Username: ptps
    Database: ptps.*

You should have complete access to any table named 'ptps.*'
(i.e., the ptps database), but not the rest of the server.
You can access the MySQL server from an OCF command prompt by
typing:

    mysql -h death -u ptps -p

and entering your password. (Note: Please don't provide a
password on the command line with the -p, as anyone who happens
to run a command like 'w' can see it plainly.) If you want to
change your password, just connect to the MySQL server and type
in the following at the MySQL command prompt:

    set password = PASSWORD('new_password');

where 'new_password' is your new password (keep the single quotes).
Feel free to email us at staff@OCF.Berkeley.EDU if you have any
other questions.

-OCF Staff
