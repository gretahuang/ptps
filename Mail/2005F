Hi,

I'm a third-year graduate student here at Cal, and I'm interested in
teaching for PTPS sometime this year.  Will there be fall classes?  Is
demand for teachers greater in one semester or the other?  Since I'm a
grad student, my schedule is pretty flexible, so I'd like to teach where
(and when) you have the greatest need.

Thanks,
Katie.

Hi,
My name is Carla Kennedy and I am the College Specialist at the Eastmont College Resource Zone 
(ECRZ) in the Eastmont Town Center in Oakland.  The ECRZ is a program within UCB's Center for 
Educational Outreach and we service individuals in the East Oakland community that are interested 
in pursuing higher education.  A special component of our program is the College Preparatory 
Program in which we serve 60 high schools students who have committed to participating in and 
receiving the on-going college preparation that we offer through workshops, one-on-one advising, 
and campus tours.

I am currently planning the master calendar for the 2005-2006 school year and I have two dates for 
test prep--one in the fall and one in spring.  It would be great if the PTPS could facilitate one 
of those sessions for us.

Please let me know how to get on your calendar as well as more general information about the 
length of your test prep "sessions" (number of weeks).

Thank you,
Carla Kennedy

during the summer?

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Simren Claire and I am a Teach for America alumni.  I
recently moved back home to central California (Modesto area) and was
interested in starting a free SAT prep course for the local high
school students.  I have heard great things about your program and was
wondering, what is your policy on other people using your material?  I
would love to be a teacher for you but being located so far away the
commute would not work and to my knowledge there are no other official
SAT prep courses in this area, leaving these students at a great
disadvantage.  Please reply back and let me know if we could work
something out.  I would be willing and actually prefer to even come to
your training session to get a better feel for your material.  And of
course to keep with your purpose I would also be providing the service
for free to the local community.

Thank you,

Simren Claire

Hi there. I'm Linda, a high school student, and I was curious about the SAT classes you offer. I was wondering if it was possible to know whether you would be offering fall sessions at this time? I'd love to take the class and I am a bit confused as to what I should do next. Should I just register for classes anyways? Even though they may be going on now? Please get back to me as soon as possible and thanks!
 
Linda

To Whom it May Concern:

I am from Lionel Wilson College Preparatory Academy, a not-for-profit public charter school 
serving Oakland, CA.  One of our goals is to help our rising high school students score high on 
their SAT's.  My question is, can your organization come to our campus to prep our students?  We 
can supply the facility and material for this to happen.  Looking forward to hear from you, and 
thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Hello,

My son, Will Henderson-Nold, took the SAT prep class last spring on Sundays
at Cal.  We didn=B9t locate his scores online after the class and he never
received the results in any manner.  Is there any way we can find out how h=
e
did on the final test?

We emailed a couple times after the class ended but didn=B9t receive a
response.


Thanks,
Susan Henderson for
Will Henderson-Nold

Once you create your account, Nithya Senra will be notified with

If you haven't already heard about Gmail, it's a new search-based webmail 
service that offers:

- Over 2,500 megabytes (two gigabytes) of free storage
- Built-in Google search that instantly finds any message you want
- Automatic arrangement of messages and related replies into 
  "conversations"
- Text ads and related pages that are relevant to the content of your 
  messages

Gmail is still in an early stage of development. But if you set up an 
account, you'll be able to keep it even after we make Gmail more 
widely available. We might also ask for your comments and suggestions 
periodically and we appreciate your help in making Gmail even better.

Thanks,

Nithya,

Thanks that would be great.  Will's considering another round of review.  I
know it was the end of the school year and everyone went off to their summer
places.

Best,

Susan

Nithya,

Thank you for sending these.  Unfortunately, we can't figure out which is
Will's, either.  He was told that the scores would be posted by initials in
reverse order, making him HW.  There's no HW (Will Henderson-Nold) or NW on
the list.  He took both the initial diagnostic and the second test.

Is there anyone who was teaching last spring on Sunday's who we can check
with?

Susan

this week, but  please let me know if there is any way that I can make it up.

Hello Nithya,

Thank you for replying back to me and I do apologize for my delayed
response, but I just been hired as an instructional teacher at UC
Merced and with its opening tomorrow we have all been swamped.
Nonetheless, considering that your test prep materials are catered to
the under served and disadvantaged students I think that it would a
perfect fit for the students surrounding UC Merced considering that
they fall into that category.  My own teaching experience and work
with disadvantage students comes from being a 2004 Teach For America
corps member.  I was located in Baltimore, MD, where I was a biology
and chemistry high school teacher.  While working as a teacher I also
worked towards and achieved my Masters degree in teaching from Johns
Hopkins.

I would like to start a SAT prep program in this area using your guys'
material.  Coming out for training sessions will be difficult
considering that I have to teach every day but I am sure that we can
work something out.  Please let me know what your requirements are for
someone to use your material and so forth.  If you have another
questions please feel free to call me at 209 678 7068.

Thank you and I look forward to working with you,

Simren

Attn:Mr/Mrs,
          
          RE: TRANSFER OF USD116,000,000.00
         
I wish to notify you that I am privileged to pursue over your profile 
today I am greatly impressed on your person. With all due respect, I 
guess my letter will not embarrass you, since I have no previous 
correspondence with you. I strongly believed, I would not regret 
approaching you in this matter.

My name is Mr.Edward Cole, I am the operational manager in account 
management section in charge of credit and foreign bills of one of 
the prime banks here in South Africa. I am writing in respect of a 
foreign customer of my bank who perished with his whole families on 
18TH JULY 2003 in KENYAN PLANE CRASH with the whole passengers aboard.

There is an account opened in this bank in 2000 by this great late 
INDUSTRIALIST who died without a written or oral 'WILL' attached to 
the account. Since his death, I personally has watched with keen 
interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one 
has come to claim his funds and no other person knows about this 
account or anything concerning it, the account has no other 
beneficiary and until his death he was the manager of his company.

The total amount involved is 116,000,000.00 USD.[One Hundred and 
Sixteen Million United States Dollar]. We wish to start the first 
transfer with $16,000,000.00 [Sixteen Million] and upon successful 
transaction without any disappointment from your side, we shall re-
apply for the transfer of the remaining balance to your account.

I have secretly discussed this matter with the general manager of the 
bank who I must involve in order to have a smooth and a successful 
transfer of the fund to any foreign bank account, which you are going 
to nominate. On this note, I decided to seek for a reliable foreigner 
who will act as the foreign beneficiary of the fund from the deceased 
by providing his/her bank account where the fund will be transferred 
for immediate investment on any viable project as no one has come up 
to be the next of kin.

The banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than 
three years without claim hence the money will be recalled to the 
government treasury as unclaimed after this long period of dormancy. 

In view of this I got your contact through my personal search to see 
if you can assist by providing your safe bank account for the 
transfer or find a reliable person who will be capable of receiving 
such amount in his or her personal account. At the conclussion of the 
transfer 60% of the fund will be for me, I will give you 25% of the 
total transfer sum, 10% for charity both in Africa and in your 
country while the remaining 5% will be set aside to settle expenses 
both parties might incur during the transfer process.

Upon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you detailed information
about the transaction. I will not fail to bring to your 
notice that this business is 100% risk and trouble free and that you 
should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can 
be finalized within 7 to 9 banking days, after you apply to the bank 
as the beneficiary of the fund from the deceased.

When you receive this letter. Kindly send me e-mail or you can call 
me or fax me. You should also include your private fax and phone 
numbers for easy and safe communication.

Tel: 874-763427915
   : 874-763427918
Fax: 874-763427916

Respectfully yours,
Mr.Edward Cole.

Hi Adetunji,
Sorry for taking so long to respond (nobody has checked this account for
quite some time). We would love for you to join us this semester as a
teacher, and if you are still interested in teaching please let me know
as
we are currently recruiting teaches for the fall semester. Courses begin
in just a few weeks and we are beginning to accept applications and
conduct interviews. I hope that all is going well.

Hello,

My name is Kevin Lee and I am the co-coordinator of True Asian Leaders (TAL), which is part of 
REACH!, the A/PI recruitment and retention center at Cal.  TAL is a two year high school 
mentorship program that mentors students from various schools within the Oakland and Richmond 
cities.  We meet each Sunday for four hours where we do various workshops, activities, as well as 
tutoring.  TAL consists of nineteen mentees who are predominantly juniors this year.

Because most of our students are juniors, they are planning to take the SATs this year.  I was 
told that PTPS provides services for students, and was interested in what your program does.  It 
would be great if you would be able to put on a workshop one of these upcoming Sundays because the 
time for testing is fast approaching.  Thank you.

K. Lee

To whom it may concern,
I work with students at Oakland High as part of a UC Berkeley college outreach program called the 
Educational Guidance Center.   A few of my juniors have wanted to take general SAT prep classes at 
the UCB location, however it is unclear on your website, when you are offering classes (which 
dates).  Additionally the telephone number that you have listed on the website does not have 
voicemail where students can leave messages.  Are you offering SAT I preparation sessions this 
fall?  Thank you for offering this program!

To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Simren Claire and I am a Teach for America alumni.  I  have
recently returned home to Central California (Modesto area) and am
interested in providing a free SAT tutoring program to the local high
school students.  I have heard great things about your program and was
wondering if I could use your material to tutor students.  I do not
know what your policy is regarding this but if we could come to some
sort of agreement it would allow me to provide a much needed service
that is not yet available here.

I look forward to hearing from you,

Simren Claire

Katie,
Thank you for getting in contact with us! We are always looking for
teachers in both the spring and the fall, and would love to have you teach
with us this fall semester. If you would like to come to one of our
informational sessions (this thurs, next tues and again next thurs) or
find us on Sproul tabling (starting tomorrow from 10a-3p), we could get
you started through the application and interview process (fairly
informal). If you have any other questions, please feel free to email this
account or myself directly or call me.

Best,

Hello Earlene,
Sorry for taking so long to respond. We will be conducting SAT classes in
the fall that will be able to prepare your daughter for the November exam
(however our course is more geared towards the December test date). We
will be updating our website www.ptps.org very soon with site offerings.
Our classes will be starting in about 2 or 3 weeks, so please check back
at our website. If you have any more questions or concerns, please do not
hesitate to contact us.
Thank you!

Hello Simren,
I'm not quite sure how we can help you, but I think it's great that you
would like to start a similar program. We are starting up a new semester,
and revise and develop our own test prep materials and use other
publications in the teaching process. I don't anticipate it being a
problem for you to attend our initial training sessions, but we do train
our teachers throughout the semester and it might be difficult to commute
from Modesto every week. Our teacher manual and student manual probably
can be shared, but I would have to check with other coordinators to make
sure that it would be permissible.
If you could let me know a little bit more about how often you could come
out here and who would be paying for the few costs of distribution that we
do have that would be greatly appreciated.

Best,
Nithya Senra

Hi Linda,
Sorry for taking so long to respond. We will be offering classes in the
fall and they will be starting in about 3 weeks. Our website will be
updated shortly and should have the new sites listed on them within the
next few days. Once the new sites are posted, I encourage you to register
for our course. It should prepare you best for the December test date, but
should also be very helpful if you are planning to take the SAT in
November.
Best,
Nithya Senra
