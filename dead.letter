Hi all-
Here's my coordinator application.  (No, I'm not neurotic, I just figured if
I didn't do it now, I'd forget.)
Devin

1.  What do you want to do and why?
I'm really interested in working in the operational side of PTPS.  I see as
the biggest challenge facing PTPS as using resources to help the most
people.  The area that I want to focus on is financial:  fundraising and
accounting.  I think that it's critical that PTPS look for outside funding
sources (grants, working with campus funding sources) and that it manage its
money better.  I'm sure that we could save money on copies and books if we
coordinated the purchase of these items and with the new administrative
structure, it will be easier for the money to managed with the Operations
Manager doing most of the copying and purchasing.

2.  What qualifications/skills do you have?
I think that there are two main skills that I have that will benefit PTPS in
the financial area.  First off I have some basic accounting skills.  I know
how to watch money and get the most I can for my money.  Secondly, I have a
good working relationship with campus administrators and student leaders and
I know who to get in touch with them to get funding.  I have worked a lot in
the past on fundraising and I'm ready to do it again for PTPS.

3.  Please mention all other time committments, and if you would like to
continue to teach SAT classes.
Next semester I (hopefully) will be a CalSO counselor again, I'm one of the
coordinators for WYSE guys (a mentoring program), I'm taking a pretty good
load of classes, and might be working on one of the ASUC campaigns.  I'm
thinking about teaching again, if I have the time and we need another verbal
teacher.
